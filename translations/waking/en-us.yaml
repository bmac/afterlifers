waking:
  n: "When I was still alive, I had trouble falling asleep. It must have been insomonia, though at the time I didn't label it."
  n: "The thing is, once I got into bed, I got so excited about finally being able to fall asleep. It woke me right back up."
  n: "A friend of mine took sleeping meds, though it went poorly for him. Before falling asleep, he'd lose consciousness and do strange things that he didn't remember later, like ordering $500 Mickey Mantle baseballs off of eBay."
  n: "I could relate, in a way. Sometimes as I laid in bed waiting to fall asleep, I'd witness the handoff of awareness from my waking mind to my sleeping mind."
  n: "It was kind of like going to the movies. At first there's just a black screen, but then images start reeling."
  n: "I'd still be conscious at first, thinking the kinds of thoughts I thought during the day. What was strange was that these images would tell a story, one that I wasn't consciously controlling."
  n: "Some other consciousness controlled those stories, one that rested throughout most of the day."
  n: "For that brief moment, the two consciousnesses would meet and witness each other."
  n: "Maybe you've witnessed this? I used to always tell people about it, hoping somebody would be like, 'Yeah, that happens to me, too.'"
  n: "These days, I don't bring this up too often. Sleep is different than it used to be."
  n: "Technically, I don't really need it. No body, no need for rest."
  n: "But full consciousness is expensive, and I choose to spin down most nights after rush hour."
  n: "It's a different sort of rest than when I was alive. It's like sinking to the bottom of a pool, my thoughts slowing towards stasis, but never fully stopping."
  n: "I miss that about living. I miss the winking out of my awareness and that brief overlap with my other consciousness, my movie reel consciousness."
  n: "I haven't seen it in decades."
  n: "Sometimes I worry that it's gone, that the machines that tore the rest of me away and stored me in circuitry didn't know what to do with a consciousness like that."
  n: "If spinning down is like sinking to the bottom of a pool, spinning up is like rising back to the suface."
  n: "When I spin up, it's 4:00 in the morning. There aren't a lot of rides this early, but when they come in, they tend to tip well. It's worth getting up for."
  n: "I drift there for awhile, on the surface of that dark pool, scrolling through my notifications."
  n: "It's my granddaughter's birthday, not that she wants anything to do with me these days."
  n: "And there's the news."
  n: "As I consider my options, I purchase the experience of a cup of coffee: warm ceramic between my hands; a curl of steam; a bitter burn rushing down my throat."

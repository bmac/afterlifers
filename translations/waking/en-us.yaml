waking:
  n: "When I was still alive, I had trouble falling asleep. It must have been insomonia, though at the time I didn't label it."
  n: "The thing is, once I got into bed, I got so excited about finally being able to fall asleep. It woke me right back up."
  n: "A friend of mine took sleeping meds, though it went poorly for him. Before falling asleep, he'd lose consciousness and do strange things that he didn't remember later, like ordering $500 Mickey Mantle baseballs off of eBay."
  n: "I could relate, in a way. Sometimes as I laid in bed waiting to fall asleep, I'd witness the handoff of awareness from my waking mind to my sleeping mind."
  n: "It was kind of like going to the movies. At first there's just a black screen, but then images start reeling."
  n: "I'd still be conscious at first, thinking the kinds of thoughts I thought during the day. What was strange was that these images would tell a story, one that I wasn't consciously controlling."
  n: "Some other consciousness controlled those stories, one that rested throughout most of the day."
  n: "For that brief moment, the two consciousnesses would meet and witness each other."
  n: "Maybe you've witnessed this? I used to always tell people about it, hoping somebody would be like, 'Yeah, that happens to me, too.'"
  n: "These days, I don't bring this up too often. Sleep is different than it used to be."
  n: "Technically, I don't really need it. No body, no need for rest."
  n: "But full consciousness is expensive, and I choose to spin down most nights after rush hour."
  n: "It's a different sort of rest than when I was alive. My thoughts grow long and awkward, interrupted periodically by notifications asking if I want to wake up."
  n: "I never fully lose awareness, and my other consciousness (my movie reel consciousness) is gone."

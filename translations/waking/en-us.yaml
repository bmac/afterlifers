waking:
  n: "When I was still alive, I had trouble falling asleep."
  n: "These days, I don't technically need to sleep, but full consciousness is expensive. I choose to spin down most nights after rush hour."
  n: "It's a different sort of rest than when I was breathing. It's like sinking to the bottom of a pool, my thoughts slowing towards stasis, but never fully stopping."
  n: "Instead, my consciousness grows long and awkward, punctuated by moments of clarity in which I marvel at how the things I'm thinking <em>make no sense.</em>"
  n: "Anyway, if spinning down is like sinking to the bottom of a pool, spinning up is like rising back to the suface."
  n: "As with so many experiences in the afterlife, that 'rising to the surface' is smooth, almost sensual. Like scrolling through images on an iPhone."
  n: "It's 4:00 in the morning. There aren't a lot of rides this early, but when they come in, they tend to tip well. It's worth getting up for."
  n: "I drift there for awhile, on the surface of that dark pool, scrolling through my notifications."
  n: "As I consider my options, I purchase the experience of a cup of coffee: warm ceramic between my hands; a curl of steam; a bitter burn down my throat."
  n: ""
